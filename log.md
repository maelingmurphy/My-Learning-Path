Today, I learned why #React sites are known to provide a fast user experience. React works with a virtual DOM & only updates the UI elements that have changed when it re-renders.

This is compared to real DOM updates, where the ENTIRE UI is updated.

    - Using template literals: strings that can have JS variables within them, enclosed by backticks
    - Destructuring objects & arrays 
    - Object literals
    - `for...of` statement

**Thoughts**: 
- It's interesting how you can control the formatting of the HTML output of JS variables, by controlling their formatting within a template literal. If you have a space between 2 variables within the template literal, that space will show up on the HTML output. If the variables in the template literal are separated onto 2 lines, the HTML output will also show a multi-line string.

    - `background-blend-mode`

- Started 'Making the BBQ page interactive' section in Responsive Design module (Scrimba FE Career Path)
    - `FormData` interface (useful for interacting with form data using JavaScript)
        - `FormData()` creates a new FormData object 
        - `FormData` has several methods that allow you to interact with data in the form 

- Finished Module 5 - Responsive Design 

**Thoughts/Notes**: 
- If you're trying to make a pill shape with `border-radius`, you need to set its value to one that is greater than the element's total height
- When you have a transition that should appear on a hover state, you don't want to apply the transition to the hover/focus selector because then the transition will only appear when you hover on the element, but will then SNAP back to the original state when you're not hovering on the button. Instead, you want to apply the transition property to the regular element selector. That way the transition will occur when you hover/focus on the element and when you move away from the element. I made these changes to my animated form I built for Scrimba's web dev challenge on 4/17.

        - `vh` - viewport height
        - `vmin` - viewport minimum
        - `vmax` - viewport maximum

**Thoughts**: 
- It is suggested to use a background image vs a regular image if an element will be on top of the image. Syntax: `background-image: url(folder/filename.jpg)`
- When using flexbox, margins don't collapse

    - CSS properties:
        - `animation` shorthand property
        - `transform` 
    - `aria-label` for accessibility with form input fields without `<label>`

**Thoughts**: 
- It was interesting to learn that you can create a responsive CSS illustration and animation by setting the size variables using a responsive unit like `em`. That way, the sizing can be controlled by the size of the parent element.

    - CSS Stairs
        - `align-self` flexbox/grid property
    - Flashing boxes
        - complex media queries 

**Thoughts**: 
- In flexbox, `align-self` aligns the flex-item on the cross axis (values: `stretch`, `center`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`)
- Using `letter-spacing` to stretch text also adds spacing after the last letter which can sometimes mess with your alignment. To remove this extra spacing, you can add a `margin-right` with a negative value equal to the value used for the letter-spacing.

    - Responsive Image Collage
        - `box-sizing` property
        - `flex-wrap` flexbox property 

**Thoughts/Notes**: 
- The `:last-child` selector matches every element that is the last child of its parent. (w3schools.com)
- The `box-sizing` property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated. By default in the CSS box model, the width and height you assign to an element is applied only to the element's content box. If the element has any border or padding, this is then added to the width and height to arrive at the size of the box that's rendered on the screen (MDN Web Docs)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing]
    - `border-box`: tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height.
    - `content-box`: gives the default CSS box-sizing behavior. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, then the element's content box will be 100 pixels wide, and the width of any border or padding will be added to the final rendered width, making the element wider than 100px

    - Reordering elements using flexbox with the `order` property 
    - Using `object-fit` for cropping images 
        - `cover` : helps keep the proportions if the image ratio has been changed with `width` and `height` properties. Useful for cropping an image 
    - Converting px to rem:
        - 16px = 1 rem. Taking any `px` value and dividing it by 16 will give you the size in `rem`. 

**Thoughts**: 
- With the `order` property, items in a parent container with `display: flex` are sorted by ascending order value and then by their source code order.

    - Started styling 'Living the simple life' mock site with CSS 

**Thoughts**: 
- Learned about using the mobile-first approach when styling a site with CSS. Using `min-width` in a media query allows for the large screen styles within the query to only be applied once the screen grows to reach the specified size or larger.

**Thoughts**: 
- Good review of using semantic HTML elements in the markup:
    - header
    - nav
    - main
    - article
    - aside 
- Learned to pay attention to hierarchy of elements when creating the HTML structure as CSS can be used to change the visual order later. Structural hierarchy is especially important for those using screen readers & other assistive technologies.

    - Media queries
    - `flex-direction`

**Thoughts**: 
- When working with `flex-direction: column`, child items are in rows and `justify-content` works vertically to arrange child items and `align-items` works horizontally. 
- When working with `flex-direction: row` (default), child items are in columns and `justify-content` works horizontally to arrange child items and `align-items` works vertically 
- `justify-content` always works on the main axis and `align-items` works on the cross-axis

    - view gatsby site in the browser: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
    - View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema: [http://localhost:8000/___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql)
- Redeploy GraphQL API: `sanity graphql deploy`  in studio folder
    - You should redeploy the GraphQL API every time you make changes to the schema that you want to use in Gatsby by running `sanity graphql deploy` from within your Sanity project directory

**Today's Progress**:
- Day 3 of the Hack the Gap Spring Hackathon
    - Continued with designing the database model for our project.
    - Installed MySQL & MySQL workbench and created my database diagram in MySQL workbench.
    - Set up Flask backend for our web app
    - Attempted to connect MySQL database to my Flask app but kept getting errors!

**Thoughts**: 
- I prefer creating my entity relationship diagram (ERD) in MySQL Workbench over Lucid Chart. It creates the appropriate foreign keys in the tables based on the relationship notations you establish between the tables. 
- I've decided to switch to SQLite for creating the actual database file to connect to Flask because of the errors I kept getting with MySQL

**Today's Progress**:
- Spent a lot of time troubleshooting Right-pointing magnifying glass:
    - Gutter indicators disappearing in VSCode 
    - My project sites appearing zoomed in when viewed on mobile due to overflow
- Continued snake game customization with theme-specific CSS variable values & mobile layout

**Thoughts**: 
- Font sizes and fixed widths can cause overflow issues when viewed on mobile. Font sizes need to be adjusted for mobile and fixed widths avoided when possible on elements so they will resize as the window is resized OR use a media query to change the size.

## March 17, 2021 (Day 61 #100DaysOfCode)

**Today's Progress**:
- Completed Module 4 of the Scrimba FE Career Path
- Worked on 'Build a Snake Game'
    - Used event KeyCodes to control snake movement by attaching an event listener to the `document` that listened for `keydown` events 
    - Used modulus to detect if snake was at grid walls
    - Used `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` to invoke a function continuously to keep the snake moving with a set time delay until the interval was cleared 
    - Used switch cases to set different `intervalTime` values (based on user selection which controls how fast the snake moves on the screen
    - Used toggle() to switch between hiding and displaying mobile controls by adding and removing the display-controls class name to the related div holding the mobile controls

**Thoughts**: 
- I'm going to add some game customization features for the user to select before starting the game and also make the game accessible for mobile users. The current game moves the snake using keystrokes, so I will have button keypad on the screen for mobile users in order to have the same functionality for moving the snake.

## March 15, 2021 (Day 59 #100DaysOfCode)

**Today's Progress**:
- Finished 'Build a dice game' in Module 4 (Scrimba FE Career Path)
    - Customized the game to include dice faces that were dynamically added via JS/CSS. I was able to incorporate some of what I learned during the #JavaScriptmas challenge on [December 8, 2020](#december-8-2020)! 

**Thoughts**
- I was able to improve on my #JavaScriptmas logic for making the dice faces by incorporating new concepts I've been learning in JS, like using `document.createElement("span")` in a for loop to create the necessary amount of span elements (for creating the dots), based on the random number that was generated by the player and then using `classList.add` to add the appropriate class to the new element for styling in CSS. 

----------------------------------------------------------

## March 14, 2021 (Day 58 #100DaysOfCode)

**Today's Progress**:

    - Started learning how to build a carousel with HTML, CSS & JS

**Thoughts**: 
- If we put position: relative; on the parent element, anything inside of it with position: absolute; will be placed absolutely, relative to that containing unit! - csstricks.com
- You can use the CSS `transform: translateY();` property to get perefect vertical alignment of elements when positioning. This was useful to use when vertically aligning the buttons after using the `top` property to position the buttons on top of the image 

----------------------------------------------------------
## March 11, 2021 (Day 55 #100DaysOfCode)

**Today's Progress**:
- Purchased domain name on namecheap.com for my portfolio/blog site! - maeling.dev
- Continued JavaScript Challenges in Module 4: Created a search bar for a list of items and used the `startsWith()` method and `keyup` event in JS to display items that match the query as you type and hide all non-matches. 

**Thoughts**: 
- I started building the search to find matches in the list using the `includes` method, but realized when I was searching for apples, both apples and pineapples were listed as matches, since technically they both include 'apples'. To be more specific with the match, I decided to go with the `startsWith` method.

## March 5, 2021 (Day 49 #100DaysOfCode)

**Today's Progress**:
- Started Module 4 (CSS & JavaScript Fundametals) on the Scrimba FE Career Path. Started the CSS Fundamentals Section with Kevin Powell. 

**Thoughts**: 
- Margin collapsing: If an element has a margin-bottom of 50px & another element under it has a margin-top of 50px, the space between them will be 50px and NOT 100px. Doesn't apply to flexbox/grid layouts. If a child element has a margin-top, it can merge with the parent's margin-top setting, even if parent has no margin value set. This can be fixed by adding padding on the parent to prevent the parent's margin from merging with the child's. In order to better understand this behavior, I made a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/maelingcodes/pen/jOVpgxQ).

----------------------------------------------------------
## March 3, 2021 (Day 48 #100DaysOfCode)

### Container Gardening Site - [Link to repo](https://github.com/maelingmurphy/Container-Gardening-Site)
**Today's Progress**:
- Used flexbox to style header. Set `display:flex` on parent header element and then set `display:flex` on nav element so menu items would line up horizontally. I then adjusted the `padding-left` property on the nav menu items to get appropriate spacing.

**Thoughts**: 
- Learned about the `list-style-position` CSS property that is used for styling lists. It sets the position of the marker relative to a list (marker for unordered list = bullet(default), marker for ordered list(numbers)). You can set it to `outside` (default) and `inside`.

### Homeschool Journal Site (Flask Web App) [Link to Repo](https://github.com/maelingmurphy/homeschool-journal)
**Today's Progress**:
- Started Scrimba's CSS Crash Course and covered:
    - CSS syntax: selectors + property-value pairs = CSS rules 
    - Ways of adding CSS to doc (inline, embedded, external stylesheet)
    - Inheritance: Elements inherit properties from their parents (usually applies to type and fonts)
    - Cascade: Declarations that are made lower down in the stylesheet will override earlier declarations 
- Learned how to use `strptime()` to convert a string to a datetime object and `strftime()` to change the format of a datetime object. Applied this to my project by changing the date display format for the Activity and Attendance tables.
- Created custom Jinja template filters to format date-related Jinja template variables within my project 

**Thoughts**: 
- I learned that you can create your own Jinja filters to modify your template variables. I created a custom filter to change the date display format. I had to add the following lines of code to my `__init__.py` file, right under the creation of the Flask app instance.
```python
# Create custom filters to use on Jinja template variables
@app.template_filter()
def datetime_format_filter(value, format='%m-%d-%Y'):
    """Convert a datetime to a different format."""
    return value.strftime(format)

app.jinja_env.filters['datetime_format_filter'] = datetime_format_filter

@app.template_filter()
def string_to_datetime_filter(value):
    """Convert string to datetime object."""
    return datetime.datetime.strptime(value, '%Y-%m-%d')

app.jinja_env.filters['string_to_datetime'] = string_to_datetime_filter
```
To apply the filter to the variable, use pipe `|` within the template variable code block in the html file: `{{ today | datetime_format_filter }}`
You can also chain multiple filters that will be applied to the variable from left to right. This was useful when I needed to first convert a string to a datetime object so I could then change the date format using `strftime()` via the datetime_format_filter: `<td>{{ activity.activity_date | string_to_datetime_filter | datetime_format_filter }}</td>`

### Homeschool Journal Site (Flask Web App) [Link to Repo](https://github.com/maelingmurphy/homeschool-journal)
**Today's Progress**:
- Learned how to use the `datetime` module and `timedelta` to calculate the week's start and end date based on a given date (current date). Created a repl to illustrate how the basic logic works (see resources).
- Added ability for user to update the data the activity table displays on `index.html` by selecting a date range and student. Wrote the appropriate database queries and logic for displaying the associated data in the table. 

**Thoughts**: 
```python
# This query does not work and yields the error: TypeError: Boolean value of this clause is not defined
activities_currentweek = db.session.query(Activity).filter(Activity.activity_date >= current_week_start and Activity.activity_date <= current_week_end).all()    
```
[This post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42681231/sqlalchemy-unexpected-results-when-using-and-and-or) gives a good explanation of why the above doesn't work and helped me to figure out the proper syntax below

    - Basic HTML file structure
    - Headings and paragraphs
    - Strong `<strong>` and emphasis `<em>` inline elements
- Worked on Homeschool Web App:

    - Wrote query to select activity data for current date (`today`) in `/index` route
    - Added select dropdown form that will eventually link to queries to show activities based on selection (Today, This Week, Next Week)

**Thoughts**: 
- I've started taking notes for my coding courses in Notion and it's been extremely helpful for organizing my notes and embedding code snippets. It is also a database system, so it's also great for organizing the various resources I've been collecting for future review.
- I ran into an issue where I was trying to test submission in one form and it would display errors in a different form on the same page even though the original form passed validation and I had not clicked the submit button on the different form. I then realized that I had to change the names of the variables attributed to the `SubmitField` so they would be different for both forms (they were previously both named `submit`). Then I updated the conditional statement in the `/index` route that checked for the the name of the submit button passed from the form(input name is passed from WTForms field name) & checked form validation before continuing with further actions. Now validation works correctly for both forms on the `index.html` page. 

```python
# In forms.py

class AddAttendanceForm(FlaskForm):
    """Add attendance form"""
    attendance_date = DateField('Date', format='%Y-%m-%d')
    student = SelectField(u'Student', choices=[])
    submit = SubmitField('Log Attendance')

class DisplayActivitiesForm(FlaskForm):
    """Display activites form"""
    display = SelectField(u'Display', choices=['Today','This Week','Next Week'])
    display_submit = SubmitField('Display')

# In routes.py

# Validation for form
if "submit" in request.form and form2.validate_on_submit():
    # Continue with further steps

# Validation for form
if "display_submit" in request.form and form3.display.validate(form3):
    # Continue with further steps
```

**Today's Progress**:
- Started Scrimba's Frontend Development Career Path and completed Module 1.

**Thoughts**: 
- In one of the introductory projects in the Frontend Development Career Path, I was introduced to using CSS custom properties(variables). This is something I need to incorporate in this project's design! CSS custom properties allow you to define a value in one place and then reference it multiple times in other places.

    - White Space
    - Color
    - Contrast
    - Scale
    - Alignment
    - Typography
    - Visual Hierarchy 
- WCAG has issued contrast guidelines for the visual representation of text and images of text. You can use contrast checking tools to help your projects adhere to these guidelines when designing (e.g. browser plugins, websites, UI design application plugins)

**Today's Progress**:
- Added ability for user to remove students and subjects (and their associated activities) from their Profile Edit pag (`profile-edit`)
- Learned how to use datetime module to create variable that holds current date. I had to pass the `today` variable to `index.html` and set it to the value attribute for the `{{ form2.attendance_date }}` field. 
```python
import datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
```
**Thoughts**: 
- I received errors when I removed a student from the database. Since I still had activities trying to show on `log.html` that were associated with that particular student id, the errors I received were SQL-related dealing with a NOT NULL constraint. I then realized I needed to also delete all associated student activities when deleting a student by accessing `student.activities`.
- I was able to get a static data HTML table working with Bootstrap Table with a filter extension that allows me to filter by the data in each column. However, I have not been able to get it to work with the dynamic data inserted via the Jinja template variables that are linked to my database queries. If I do end up getting this to work with my data, I will need to change my activity.status 'Not Completed' variable to 'Incomplete' so it will sort properly in the bootstrap-table. I may come back to trying to add this feature later but I did want to note what external dependencies I had to include to get the static TEST table on `log.html` working for Bootstrap Table - Filter Control:
    - CSS (place in <head> of `base.html`): 
        - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-table@1.18.2/dist/bootstrap-table.min.css">`
    - JS (place right before `</body>` in `base.html`):
        -  `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap-table/1.10.0/bootstrap-table.js"></script>`

**Today's Progress**:
- Updated `/delete` route so activity records can be removed from the db via the delete button on the `log.html` page
- Added flash messaging to `update` route 
- Created user profile page (`profile.html`) that displays user's current list of students and subjects 
- Started working on an edit profile page (`profile-edit.html`) where user can add/remove students and subjects from their account.
    - Added functionality for user to add students and subjects to their account

**Thoughts**: 
- Glad to find out I can display two different FlaskForm classes on one html page. I did this so a user can add a student or a subject on the `profile-edit.html` page. When instantiating the forms in the route (`/profile-edit`), I made sure to have two different variable names for the forms and pass those two names through the render_template function to display the form fields via Jinja template variable names in `profile-edit.html`.

**Today's Progress**:
- Added column for a delete button in attendance log table on `attend.html`. Linked to database in `/delete/attendance` route to commit the deletion changes. 
- Linked form data to database in`/update` route so user can update an activity record. User selects activity record on `log.html`, which takes them to `update.html`. They are then presented with a form with the current activity data populating the form. The user can then make changes in the form and upon submission, the changes are updated and committed in the database.
- Added some CSS styling (`display:flex`) to the attendance log form. Will need to add media queries to display as block for smaller viewports

### Homeschool Journal Site (Flask Web App) [Link to Repo](https://github.com/maelingmurphy/homeschool-journal)
**Today's Progress**:
- Learned how to pass an object into a WTForms form to be able to autofill certain form fields 
- Learned how to pass URL arguments to Flask routes
- Added `/update` route which takes the activity title as an argument (passed from 'Update' button in table on `log.html`) and displays a form to edit activity details (need to populate with user's data for the specific activity record and link to database in order to commit changes)
- Figured out how to prepopulate data for all fields in the form shown when a user clicks to update their activity record. Form details are populated via the `/update` route and shown on `update.html`.

**Thoughts**: 
- The code below, which links to a WTForms TextAreaField, does NOT show the user's description that was saved to the db. Setting the value in this case does not prepopulate the form with this data from `activity.description`. 
```html
 <div class="form-group">
        {{ form.description.label }}
        {{ form.description(size=500, class_='form-control', value=activity.description) }}
</div>
```
but the code blocks for other WTForm fields (StringField, DateField) work at populating the user data from the db using the following code:
```html
<div class="form-group">
    {{ form.title.label }}
    {{ form.title(size=100, class_='form-control', value=activity.title) }} 
    {% for error in form.title.errors %}
    <span style="color:red;">[{{ error }}]</span>
    {% endfor %}
</div>

<div class="form-group float-item">
    {{ form.activity_date.label }}
    {{ form.activity_date(class_='datepicker form-control', value=activity.activity_date) }}
    {% for error in form.activity_date.errors %}
    <span style="color:red;">[{{ error }}]</span>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
```
- I'm having issues prepopulating my Update Activity form with user data because I cannot get the modal links to pass the activity id to the `/log` route. I think I may be able to avoid some issues by creating a separate `/update` route and view function and remove the modal windows from `log.html`.

- Diplayed activity records in table in ascending order: `activities = current_user.activities.order_by(Activity.activity_date).all()`
- Worked on 'Update Activity' modal on log.html. Modal window now shows field data associated with the specific activity record, to allow user to update an activity. Still working on how to prepopulate the checkbox if activity has already been completed (linked to WTForms BooleanField object). Still need to pass data to '/update' route to actually add any changes from form data to the database. Also need to learn how to prepopulate the student and subject dropdown fields in the modal window.

**Today's Progress**:
- Learned about how to undo changes in my repository with `git checkout`, `git revert` and `git reset`
- Reverted project to its state on 1/20/21
- Added student_id to Activity model and changed student-activity relationship to one-to-many in `models.py`
- Correctly passed student_id and subject_id to activity table when adding a new activity in `/add` route 
- Added `user_id` to `Subject` model. Changed user-subject relationship to one-to-many and removed user_subject helper table
- Used conditional logic to convert Boolean status data from Activity Form to "Completed"(True=1) or "Not Completed"(False=0), which was passed to the activity object in the database for the status field. 
- Learned how to implement FontAwesome icons within buttons and read about best practices for accessibility when using icons 
- Added ability to add attendance data for user's students on `attendance.html`
- Created a table to display all the attendance records associated with a user

**Thoughts**: 
- I feel like I've gone in loops today trying to understand how to write queries in Flask-SQLAlchemy. I am trying to understand why my subject and student name data don't show up in my Activity Log table. Now I'm not sure if I should save the subject and student names directly as fields in the Activity model OR if I should try to query the database to save the student and subject ids to the Activity model and then run another query when it's time to display the student and subject names in the Activity log (on `/log` view). I've made changes to my files tonight but I'm not pushing anything (except for my project log) because I probably should start with a clean slate for tomorrow since I'm in such a state of confusion.

**Today's Progress**:
- Passed 'Add Subject' form data from `index.html` to '/index` route.
- Linked 'Add Subject' form data to database in `/index` route and learned how to insert data into table using a backref from a many-to-many relationship 

**Thoughts**: 
- (Referencing the code in the `\index` route in `routes.py`. I kept getting this error (`TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable`) when I was trying to link the student object with the backref ('admin'). I then realized I needed to append the  `current_user.id` to the admin property of the student object I created. I needed to use the 'admin' backref in this manner because I am dealing with a many-to-many relationship betweent the user and subject tables. 
```python
# The code that gave me the TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
for name in subject_names:
            subject = Subject(subject_name=name, admins=current_user.id)
            db.session.add(subject)
            db.session.commit()

# The correct way to link the current_user to the student object, via the backref
# 'admin' that was created via the many-to-many relationship between user and subject
# tables
for name in subject_names:
            subject = Subject(subject_name=name)
            subject.admins.append(current_user) # Using backref to associate subject with current user
            db.session.add(subject)

**Today's Progress**:
- Studied the differences between declaring models for one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
- Added 2 helper/association tables (user_subject, student_activity) (required for many-to-many relationships) to `models.py` and updated the models that required the `db.relationship()` function to relate properly to each other. 
- Updated form structure on `index.html` so user can add students and subjects to their profile. 

**Thoughts**: -
- I ran into errors when adding my helper tables and updating my models. I was able to create the migration script, but received an error (`raise ValueError("Constraint must have a name")`) when trying to run `flask db upgrade`. I was able to implement [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45527323/flask-sqlalchemy-upgrade-failing-after-updating-models-need-an-explanation-on-h) which required adding a `naming_convention` to my __init__.py file. The solution worked after I deleted my existing database - `app.db`, `migrations/` folder and then ran `flask db init`, `flask db migrate` and finally `flask db upgrade `.
- To turn on debugger when running app,  run `export FLASK_DEBUG=True` in the terminal before running `flask run`

- Removed 'Add Student' fields from registration form
- Added 'Add Student(s)' form to index.html and updated the `/index` route so information passed from the form gets added to the database (names added to `student` table associated with user_id, student_number field in `user` table)
- Added conditional statment to index.html so the 'Add Student' section only shows if a user doesn't have a student number saved in the `user` table (e.g. `{% if not current_user.student_number %}`)
- Added CSS styling to Flash messaging by category

**Today's Progress**:
- Figured out how to dynamically add input fields to a form based on a user's select input. I was able to remove and add fields so the field number matched the user's select number. I learned more about how to interact with the DOM using JavaScript.
- Added an app.js file to my project and linked it on `base.html`


**Thoughts**: 
- Ran into issues today trying to figure out how to pass data from dynamically generated fields to the route using WTForms. I had to use a specific naming sequence for my input fields and `request.form.get("<name>")` to be able to access the data in those fields that populated based on the user's input. This is my workaround till I learn something better!

**Today's Progress**:
- Added `RegistrationForm` class to `forms.py`
- Installed `Email()` validator external dependency from WTForms: `$ pip install email-validator`
- Added registration form structure to `register.html`
- Added link to registration page below login form on `login.html`
- Added `/register` view on `routes.py` 
- Added custom messages for WTForms validation errors on `forms.py`

**Thoughts**: 
- When you define a class in Python, you can create class variables and instance variables. A class variable will be shared by all instances and an instance variable is unique to each instance. A good example of this in my project is my `RegistrationForm` class in `forms.py`.

**Today's Progress**:
- Added email field to 'user' database model
- Added 'login' view to `routes.py`
- Added LoginForm class to `forms.py`
- Created login.html to display login form 
- Added Activity class in `models.py`
- Fixed Alter table errors due to SQLite, followed [these instructions](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/). Had to make adjustments to database instance in `app/__init__.py`

**Thoughts**: 
 - Learned about the concept of multiple inheritance in Python and how it leads to the ability to use mixins to add different features to a class.
 - You can use a `pass` statement when writing a loop or function in python to serve as a placeholder, since you can't have an empty body. If you left it with an empty body, the interpreter would give an error. 
 - You can apply `index=True` as an attribute to a database model field in order to speed up queries on this column
 ```python
 # Example for the user table in models.py

 class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(64), index=True, unique=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), index=True, unique=True)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(128))
    students = db.relationship('Student', backref='admin', lazy='dynamic')
 ```
 - To view tables you created in sqlite, type `sqlite3 app.db` in the terminal. Then at the `sqlite>` command line, type `.tables`. To see schema for a specific table, type `.schema table`. To see all data in a specific table, type

### Homeschool Journal Site (Flask Web App) [Link to Repo](https://github.com/maelingmurphy/homeschool-journal)
**Today's Progress**:
- Learned how to view previews of my markdown (.md) files in VSCode. Right-click on code editor tab for file and select 'Open Preview'.
- Completed Chapter 4: Databases in the Flask Mega-Tutorial
- Integrated Flask-SQLAlchemy with my web app! Added User and Student database models in models.py  
- Learned how to create a shell context so you can open up a Python interpreter with the relevant elements from your project, pre-imported. Added `make_shell_context()` function to journal.py

**Thoughts**: 
- When saving datetime information in your database, it is recommended to work with UTC dates and times. This will ensure uniform timestamps regardless of where the users are located. The timestamps will then be converted to the user's local time when they are displayed. - (miguelgrinberg.com)
- Working with Flask-Migrate (Alembic):
    -  `flask db init`: initializes the migration repository 
    - `flask db migrate -m "<optional message>"`: generates the migration script
    - `flask db upgrade`: applies the changes to the database
    - `flask db downgrade`: undoes the last migration 
- Changes to the database are made within the context of a session, which is accessed through `db.session`. Changes that have been added (`db.session.add()`) are not actually committed to the database until `db.session.commit()` is called. `db.session.rollback()` aborts the session and removes any changes stored in it. 
- Database queries:
    - All models have a query attribute which allows you to run database queries
    - Query to return all elements of a specific class called User: User.query.all())
    - Query to return a user whose id = 1: User.query.get(1)
    ```python
    # Query to get all posts written by a user
    u = User.query.get(1)
    posts = u.posts.all()

    # Query to print post author and body for all posts
    posts = Post.query.all()
    for p in posts:
        print(p.id, p.author.username, p.body)

    # Query to get all users in reverse alphabetical order
    User.query.order_by(User.username.desc()).all()
    ```
- SQLAlchemy provides the use of `db.relationship`, which gives you a high-level view of the relationships between tables without having to deal explicitly with foreign keys
- The `flask shell` command helps to set up a Python interpreter with the imports relevant to your application. You can create a "shell context" that names which symbols you want to pre-import. You can write this "shell context" function in the main file used to run the app with an `app.shell_context_processor` decorator. When ready to use, run `flask shell` in terminal BEFORE opening up a Python interpreter.

## January 10, 2021 (Day 3 #100DaysOfCode)

### Homeschool Journal Site (Flask Web App) [Link to Repo](https://github.com/maelingmurphy/homeschool-journal)
**Today's Progress**:
- Created mock objects and control statements to display activity information in table on log.html page until I can start pulling in info from the database. 
- Added new view function for displaying attendance history ('/attendance')
- Worked through Flask Mega-Tutorial (Chapter 2: Templates, Chapter 3: Web Forms)
- Made a dynamic WTForms SelectField with mock `students` and `subjects` object
- Added field validation with error displays and flash messaging 

**Thoughts**: 
- Creating mock objects can be useful when you're working on one part of the application but the other aspects of the system haven't been created yet. 
- Jinja2 is a template engine that comes with the Flask framework. The `render_template()` function takes a template filename and template arguments and then converts the placeholders, indicated by `{{ ... }}` blocks, to actual values. Control statements are given inside `{% ... %}` blocks.
- `GET` requests typically return information to the client(e.g. web browser). `POST` requests typically used when browser submits form data to the server. 
- Using the "with" construct in Flask template: From Miguel Grinberg -  " "with" in this situation is that this is more or less similar to using "with" in regular Python code. Basically what you get is that the variable defined as part of the with declaration can be used anywhere between the "with" and the "endwidth"."
- The `url_for()` function generates URLS, where the argument to url_for() is the endpoint name, which is the name of the view function. 
- You can use `os.urandom(24).hex()` to generate a random key, after importing the `os` library in Python

## January 9, 2021 (Day 2 #100DaysOfCode)

### Homeschool Journal Site (Flask Web App) [Link to Repo](https://github.com/maelingmurphy/homeschool-journal)
**Today's Progress**:
- Added modal windows for editing an activity and viewing activity details on log.html page 
- Installed Flask-SQLAlchemy via terminal: `pip install flask-sqlalchemy`
- Installed Flask-Migrate via terminal to use with database migration framework, Alembic: `pip install flask-migrate`
- Added Config class to configuration file (config.py) and added if else logic to app.py for choosing which configuration attributes to apply to the Config class. 
- Added SQLALCHEMY configuration variables to config.py file 
- Changed file structure of app. Made the application a package instead of a module. Added routes.py and __init__.py to app/ folder.
- Created a migration repository using Flask-Migrate. Got STUCK because Flask-Migrate was not detecting the table that I created in models.py. Going to walk through the Flask Mega-Tutorial to see if I detect what the problem is. 
    - Completed Chapter 1: Hello World!

**Thoughts**: 
- The 'OS' module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS is included in Python's standard utility modules (no need to install externally). `os.path` is a sub-module of OS module and is commonly used for path name manipulation. `os.path.dirname(path)` is a method that gets the directory name from a specified path. `os.path.abspath(path)` is a method that returns the pathname to the path that is passed in as a parameter to this function. 
- It's important to consider the principle of 'separation of concerns' when deciding the location for your app's configuration variables. Instead of putting them in the same file where you create your application, you can create a configuration class in a separate Python module. For my project, I'm creating a configuration class in config.py in the top-level directory. 
- Routes are the different URLS that the app serves to the user. Handlers for the app routes are called view functions. These view functions are mapped to one or more route URLs and serves a specific URL depending on the logic defined in the function. The @app.route decorator creates a relationship between the URL given as an argument and the function (miguelgrinberg.com)
- If your application is a module (e.g. app.py), then the templates folder should be next to that module. If your application is a package (e.g. app/), the templates folder is inside your package
- Flask-Migrate: The `flask db` sub-command is used to manage various database migration scenarios. `flask db init` creates the migration repository. `flask db migrate` creates a migration automatically. 
- Make sure to type `python3` in the terminal BEFORE I try to run Python code in the terminal! Forgetting to do so results in a `...can't read /var/mail/...` error

**Today's Progress**:
- Installed Flask-WTF to use with creating forms whose input can be validated: `$ pip install flask flask-WTF`
- Installed python-dotenv in order to use .env file to store SECRET_KEY variable: `pip install python-dotenv`
- Started creating form on 'add.html' using FlaskForm 
- Added config files with SECRET_KEY info to enable CSRF protection 

**Thoughts**: 
- WTForms is a Python library used for handling forms. It can be used via the Flask plugin, Flask-WTF
- Routes give instructions on what should be served to the user based on the URL they visit within the app. My routes for this app are defined in my app.py file
- Form classes are Python models that are used to validate the data submitted in forms.
- Jinja templates are used to render the HTML forms that are displayed to the user
- It's common to use CapitazliedWords when naming Python classes (e.g. AddActivity)
- You have to set up a secret key in order to use features like flask-login and CSRF protection. I encountered this error (RuntimeError: A secret key is required to use CSRF.)  when trying to view my form I created using WTForms. 
- It's best to use a separate configuration file for storing the configuration variables that will be applied to the Flask app. 
- Environment variables are stored in the system memory of the device running the app and can be temporarily created via the terminal: (e.g. `$ export SECRET_KEY='o9uaglkiDjro')`. The variable exists as long as you keep the terminal open. To check the variable value, `echo $SECRET_KEY`

- Studied how to submit API requests with Python 

**Thoughts**: 
- I understand much more about how to submit API requests with Python. I was able to successfully consume API data from some of the tracking APIs and quickly realized that I won't be able to get tracking data with them unless I used them to create the the tracking number in the first place as a business sending out packages. At least that's what I'm assuming right now since my requests were successful but the response data was empty when I addeded courier name and tracking number as parameters to my GET request. Time to pivot to another project idea.

**Thoughts**: 
- Learned that you can use the 'requests' library in Python for making API calls 
- I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to extract tracking data using 2 different APIs (Tracking More & AfterShip). I feel like I need a better understanding of how to work with APIs so I will find some resources that take me through the process of working with APIs in Python.

    - run flask app from Terminal export `FLASK_APP=app` `export FLASK_ENV=development` `python3 -m flask run`

**Thoughts**: 
- I learned that 'NANO' and 'VI' are simple text editors you can access from within the Terminal. 
- You can create virtual environments within the Terminal (Create Virtual Environment: `python3.7 -m venv my_env` Activate: `source my_env/bin/activate`  Deactivate: `deactivate`)
- It took a lot of trial and error but I was finally able to set up a local development environment to run Python and Flask! Ran into issues with updating my Git version and getting my system to recognize the update, but I was able to eventually resolve that by making sure that the PATH where the updated version was stored was prioritized over the PATH that the Apple-provided version of Git was stored.

**Thoughts**: 
- Received this helpful explanation on the different methods for getting elements from the DOM with JS:
"...The getElementsByClassName() method returns a collection of all elements in the document with the specified class name, as an HTMLCollection object. To use it you need to assign the event listeners such as: next[0].addEventListener. A cleaner way is to use document.querySelector() instead of document.getElementsByClassName(). Since that document.querySelector() returns only one element, which is what you want. The newer querySelector() and querySelectorAll() methods are my go-to methods for DOM access. The were introduced in 2013 in response to the popularity of jQuery at that time." - @galser from Scrimba Discord Chat

**Today's Progress**:
- Finished CS50 Finance Project!!
    - Added the ability for user to add to their cash for the 'personal touch' requirement. 

**Thoughts**: 
Validating the cash input was an interesting task. I ended up using `replace()` for removing potential commas so I could convert the input to a float. I then used regex to search for periods so I could check using `split()` how many numbers were after the decimal place. I created a new route "/add" to run a function that would update the cash in the database and also reflect the changes in the user's overview table on the front-end.

- CS50 Finance Project: Worked on "/sell" and "/history" routes:
    - Completed the implementation of sell in such a way that it enables a user to sell shares of a stock (that he or she owns).
        - Require that a user input a stock’s symbol, implemented as a select menu whose name is symbol. Render an apology if the user fails to select a stock or if (somehow, once submitted) the user does not own any shares of that stock.
        - Require that a user input a number of shares, implemented as a text field whose name is shares. Render an apology if the input is not a positive integer or if the user does not own that many shares of the stock.
        - Submit the user’s input via POST to /sell.
    - Complete the implementation of history in such a way that it displays an HTML table summarizing all of a user’s transactions ever, listing row by row each and every buy and every sell.
        - For each row, make clear whether a stock was bought or sold and include the stock’s symbol, the (purchase or sale) price, the number of shares bought or sold, and the date and time at which the transaction occurred.

**Thoughts**: 
- I was having THE hardest time getting the SQL query output that I desired, which involved getting the sum of total shares for each symbol (positive - BUY & negative - SELL values). Someone in the CS50 discord mentioned using `AS` in a query in response to someone else's question and after further research, I found that I could use it to help with my problem! Using 'AS' in a SQL query allows you to create a column alias. Essentially a column alias is a column that exists only for the duration of the query. I used it to create a column alias called 'shares_total' that consisted of the result from `SUM(shares)` across all my transactions grouped by symbol and matched the logged-in user. Here's my SQL query snippet:
```
rows = db.execute("SELECT SUM(shares) AS shares_total, symbol, price, stock_name FROM transactions WHERE users_id = ? GROUP BY symbol", session["user_id"])

```
- I also learned that you have to have some workarounds if you want to refer to a column alias in a WHERE clause. Column aliases can be used in GROUP BY, HAVING or ORDER BY clauses.
- If I want to format my numbers as currency, I can use the `usd` filter in my jinja template (HTML doc). Example: `<td>{{ total_value | usd }}</td>`

    - Learned how to create a regex that would match and return to a list consecutive repeats of a substring

**Thoughts**: 
I've made more progress on this DNA program today than I have in all the days since I started working on this problem till now. I know for a fact that taking a break from the problem set and doing the freeCodeCamp 'Scientific Computing with Python Certification' curriculum up to the last Regular Expressions module really helped me to have a better understanding of the basics of the Python language.

**Today's Progress**:
- Walked through this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy4N5Y3bRvA) to better understand how to use DictReader from the csv module to parse CSV files in Python
- Downloaded Python3 to my Mac OS: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Downloaded the atom editor: atom.io
- Ran a small python program from my MacOS terminal window
- Started freeCodeCamp's 'Python for Everybody' course to help me better understand the basics of Python programming.  

**Thoughts**: 
- As I'm working through the 'DNA' problem, I realize I need a much better foundational understanding of the csv module and creating dictionaries and accessing their values in Python. Hopefully this will help me in trying to figure out how to pass through the STR values in my program by just reading them in from the fieldnames of the database CSV file, instead of hardcoding them in my program.

**Thoughts**: I was stuck on how to implement the logic for some `if` statements in one of my `for` loops and was surprised at how much things began to make more sense once I started explaining my thought process out loud! I really do need a rubber duck for my desk lol! 

----------------------------------------------------------
## March 31, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
- Continued working on blur filter for pset 4 in CS50

**Thoughts**: Drawing a 3x3 box and identifying which pixels would need to be counted for the average for each pixel in the box definitely helped me start to visualize how to approach this problem. 

----------------------------------------------------------

## March 2, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
- Finished coding my program for the 'runoff' challenge in pset3 and submitted it successfully! 

**Thoughts**: I realized today that the reason I was having problems with some of my functions were because of not understanding how return statements should be used within functions.

## February 1, 2020
**Today's Progress**:
- Completed and submitted the 'readability' program for problem set 2 in CS50

**Thoughts**:
In solving this coding challenge, I learned the importance of making sure I was working with the right data types so my Coleman-Liau equation yielded accurate values. For example, using `float` instead of `int`, gave me more accuracy in my values to be used in the final equation since dividing two `int`s could lead to truncation of values, ultimately leading to a final incorrectly computed value.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed learning how to tailor CSS animations using `@keyframes` and other properties like `animation-timing-function`, `cubic-bezier`, `animation-duration` and `animation-iteration-count` . I was a little familiar with some of the animation concepts from my days of tinkering with animations in After Effects, so it was cool to see it translate over to CSS! In the Applied Accessibility section, it was great to learn about how to make more mindful html structuring and overall design decisions to improve web accessibility for all who use it.

**Thoughts**: It was fascinating to learn how computers can trasnmit so many different forms of electronic media using just 0s and 1s! I now know how to represent integers using just 0s and 1s. I also loved getting started on my project using Scratch, a block-based programming language made by MIT. My 4yr old saw how much fun I was having on Scratch that he came over and asked if he could help me with the project! I also learned that they have Scratch Jr. for kids, so I can't wait to download that for him!

- Worked on CSS positioning and floats 

**Thoughts**: I ran into some difficulties installing Ruby during the installation of Xcode. Apparently, I had a previous version of Xcode on my system that wasn't fully removed after I had dragged the app to the trash (noob move). Thankfully, I was able to find some advice on StackOverflow on how to fully remove Xcode from my system so I could proceed with a fresh installation of Xcode. It was a little frustrating, but gave me some practice on reading error messages and navigating my folders using the command line!
